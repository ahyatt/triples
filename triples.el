;;; Commentary:
;; Triples is a library implementing a data storage based on the idea of
;; triples: subject, predicate, objects, plus some extra metadata. This data
;; structure provides a way to store data according to an extensible schema, and
;; provide an API offering two-way links between all information stored.
;;
;; This package requires either emacs 29 or the emacsql package to be installed.
